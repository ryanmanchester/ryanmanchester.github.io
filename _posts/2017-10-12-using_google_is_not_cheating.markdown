After finishing the Intro to Ruby units and moving pretty quickly through HTML and CSS, I am finding Procedural Ruby to be quite the challenge. So challenging, that in some of the labs a *HINT* will suggest doing a Google search. In a moment of pure desperation, I followed that hint and it took me to an exact solution for the lab. I immediately started to panic because I've been taught my entire life that if you don't come up with an answer on your own, you are cheating. Not only did you not "earn the grade," but you didn't learn the subject matter. Then, a thought occured that this is a computer programming ONLINE course and the lab had a section telling us to search out the information, so I calmed down and looked at the solution. 

I was amazed to find out that not only did the solution make sense to me, but I could take it apart to understand how it worked, as well as learn how to be more abstract in my own coding. I am starting to understand that a subject such as history, where the information has been recorded (regardless of how accurate) and won't change too often, memorizing facts is how we "learn" them. On the opposite end of the spectrum there is coding which exisits as a continuously evolving language in the real world. Since we also live in the real world, searching for a solution or a hint online is sometimes necessary to save time and get out of your head.  In other words, Google is not cheating.
